### ## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by library, with each section containing notebooks and scripts that cover specific concepts.

* **`📁 01-NumPy`**: Covers the fundamentals of NumPy, from array creation and indexing to mathematical operations and broadcasting.
    * `📄 numpy_basics.ipynb`: Introduction to NumPy arrays, data types, and core functions.
    * `📄 array_manipulation.ipynb`: Slicing, reshaping, and stacking arrays.

* **`📁 02-Pandas`**: Focuses on data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
    * `📄 series_and_dataframes.ipynb`: Introduction to Series and DataFrame objects.
    * `📄 data_cleaning_and_wrangling.ipynb`: Techniques for handling missing data, filtering, grouping (`.groupby()`), and merging datasets.

* **`📁 03-Matplotlib-and-Seaborn`**: Contains notebooks for practicing data visualization.
    * `📄 basic_plots_with_matplotlib.ipynb`: Creating line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.
    * `📄 advanced_visuals_with_seaborn.ipynb`: Using Seaborn for more aesthetic and complex statistical plots.

* **`📁 mini-projects`**: A folder for small exercises where I apply skills from all libraries to a single dataset.
